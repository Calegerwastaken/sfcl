## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can Report vulnerabilities through the
[discord server](https://discord.gg/shittylist) or by DM'ing Caleger
(caleger), SLEMNS (slemns), or Tueml (tueml). Responses to vulnerability reports usually take
around 3 hours to more than a day, depending on how difficult fixing a
vulnerability is.
